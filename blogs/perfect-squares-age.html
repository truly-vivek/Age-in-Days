        <h1>Perfect Square Numbers: A Unique Age Milestone</h1>
        <p>Perfect square numbers are an interesting concept in mathematics. These numbers are the result of multiplying an integer by itself, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. When your age becomes a perfect square, it's a rare and fun milestone worth celebrating!</p>

        <h2>What Is a Perfect Square Number?</h2>
        <p>A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer multiplied by itself. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1:</strong> 1 x 1 = 1</li>
            <li><strong>4:</strong> 2 x 2 = 4</li>
            <li><strong>9:</strong> 3 x 3 = 9</li>
            <li><strong>16:</strong> 4 x 4 = 16</li>
            <li><strong>25:</strong> 5 x 5 = 25</li>
            <li><strong>36:</strong> 6 x 6 = 36</li>
            <li><strong>49:</strong> 7 x 7 = 49</li>
            <!-- Add more examples if needed -->
        </ul>
        <p>Perfect squares are significant because they reflect the beauty and symmetry of numbers. When your age becomes a perfect square, it's a milestone worth remembering!</p>
